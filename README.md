# Team Machine

For machining teams.

## Development

* Frontend tooling is based on [blendid](https://github.com/vigetlabs/blendid) by Viget
* To dev, make sure to have `yarn` installed
* Run `yarn` to install all the node modules
* When you're ready to dev, run `yarn run blendid`, which will give you a dev server and browser sync.
* The site will be output to the public directory, and this is the only thing that should be synced to the server. Gulp-gh-pages is installed to make it easier to deploy on GH pages. See the [blendid docs](https://github.com/vigetlabs/blendid) for more info on that.
